    "In this problem set, you are going to be working with data related the deep sandstone aquifer of northeastern Illinois. This aquifer has been in the local news around Joliet and Aurora recently because of large and continuing declines in heads due to 150+ years of unsustainable withdrawals. [Click here](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/99644/gwavailneildeepaquiferfactsheet2_2015-02.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y) to read a short paper discussing the issue, and [click here](https://www.theherald-news.com/2017/03/28/joliet-explores-options-on-future-water-supplies/ax3gcyb/) to read a recent local news article. Many communities and industries in this region, particularly Will, Kendall, Kane, and McHenry Counties, rely on deep sandstone wells as their source of water. "

Joliet is in Will County, where sandstone usage persists. In fact, `Joliet #10` is located at the center of the cone of depression."
